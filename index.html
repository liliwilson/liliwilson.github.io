        Hi! I'm a fourth year undergraduate studying computer science at MIT with a focus on computer systems.
    </p>

    <p>
        Most recently, I worked at <a href="https://www.warp.dev/" target="_blank">Warp</a> building a modern and
        collaborative terminal. I have also directed <a href="https://hackmit.org" target="_blank">HackMIT</a> and <a
            href="https://blueprint.hackmit.org" target="_blank">Blueprint</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
        Aside from computers, I enjoy spending time playing ultimate frisbee, learning German,
        and solving crossword puzzles (I've recently started getting into construction, too!).
    </p>

    <p>
        You can find some of my favorite projects <a href="projects.html">here</a>,
        and some of the puzzles I've written <a href="puzzles.html">here</a>.
